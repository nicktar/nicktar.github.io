# Mission statement: # 

Over the time I migrated my blog from http://blog.de to my own host using serendipity and now, after about 2 years of hibernation, to github pages with jekyll. It's always been kind of a `log.info` for my brain. So it might be useful for someone or the other but in a way it was never intended to be.

The original scope of this blog was to write about obstacles and roadblocks I encountered while developing my Apache Wicket pet projects but it soon broadened to everything that struck me as odd or that I found interesting while working on software. While 'everything' has to be taken with a huge grain of salt since my time is very limited and spread very thin between work, actually doing my pet projects and my other hobbies, I try to value quality above quantity in my posts even if I don't claim or even aim to offer best of breed solutions ready to use. The tales told here are just that tales of me working on software they aren't intended to solve your problems even if they explain how I solved mine. Don't take them as How-Tos even if some titles claim otherwise, they're more like How-I-Did-Its anyway.

As this blog somewhat mirrors my desk and I never subscribed to any clean desk policy, you might find it hard to read or cluttered. Additionally, I expect you as a member of the target audience to sport a decent and modern browser. I'm no web designer and this is no professional site so I really can't be bothered to check browser compatibility at all. 

# About the author: # 
<img width="140" height="140" align="right" src="/assets/avatar.jpg" />Hi, it's I, your author. I've been a software-developer, computer enthusiast, hobby photographer, cynic and sarcast for more years than I care to count. I caught up with programming quite late (as in late teens) and was told by a friend of mine that due to this fact I'd never be able to write really good and elegant programs. I'd be able to learn how to code but that I'd be using steamroller tactics forever. I hope I proved him wrong at some point during the last years, at least that's what my superiors told me...

My first exposure to Java and Apache Wicket came when a former employer decided to rebuild his ageing PHP based shop system and while not part of the decision, I was more than happy to move over to Java and soon fell hopelessly in love with Wicket and Hibernate . Unfortunately my current employer isn't using any of these and so I keep myself happy working on my pet projects after dark.

Since then I stopped using Wicket, mainly because my focus was on maintaining a persistence framework and switching to REST based web services. My current focus is on web- and microservices and I'm just getting my feet wet with Angular 2 and Typescript.
