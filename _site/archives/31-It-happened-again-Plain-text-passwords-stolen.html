<p>Today another case of criminal grade thoughtlessness made the (german) <a title="article (german)" target="_blank" href="http://heise.de/-1652304">IT news</a>. The on-line dating platform <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetone.com/">meetOne</a> was found to grant access to data like &quot;childrenNumber&quot;, &quot;schooling&quot;, &quot;yearlyIncome&quot;, &quot;sexuality&quot;  and &quot;searchOneNightStand&quot; or the plain-text password along with the matching email address of everyone to anyone who was able to change a single URL-Parameter. This change was a simple increase or decrease of a number not some fancy CrossSiteScripting-style JavaScript- or math-voodoo. </p>
<p>So they are not only storing passwords in plain-text or encrypted (not salted and hashed), they weren't even validating the user input needed to access this data. What's even worse, in a statement Nils Hennig, founder of meetOne and manager of meetOne GmbH, a servicer to meetOne International LLC, the company behind meetOne, told the paper, that &quot;no sensitive data [...] could be accessed&quot;.</p>
<p>How in hell isn't ones sexuality, the yearly income, every message one sends or receives on their page, ones interest in a one night stand, ones private photos and the password, that's most likely in use on countless other services &quot;sensitive data&quot;?<br /></p>
