<p>I'm stuck with an ancient version of DevPartner at work. For those of you luckily not knowing, what DevPartner is - It's a Profiler and it's the single worst documented software I was ever forced to use.<br />
When profiling a specific functionality to find out why it takes as long as it does, it's much more useful to write a UnitTest to profile said functionality than to invoke the whole stack from browser/applicationserver to database and below, which don't do much except from polluting your results. But since the latest Eclipse-Plugin for DevProfiler is aimed at Eclipse 3.0 (remember, that was released back in June 2004) there is no easy or even documented way to do so.<br />
Googleing isn't really useful until you remember that some parameter like -Xrun did the trick a couple of months back when you were trying to get this to work for the last time (wasting about a days worth of time trying to figure out, how). Provided with this parameter, Google points you to <a title="DevParnet Installation Guide" target="_blank" href="http://supportline.microfocus.com/Documentation/books/DevPartner/doc/DPJ/DPJ44/PDF/Installing_DevPartner_Java.pdf">the installation guide</a> (along with a couple of knowledge-base entries on how to manually integrate DevPartner into IntelliJ and NetBeans) where you can find a chapter filed under &quot;Configuring Application Servers&quot; named &quot;Manually invoking the Profiler&quot; and &quot;Using -Xrun to Invoke the Profiler&quot;. I don't know if it's just me or if an installation guide's chapter about integration into application servers is a slightly weird place to hide that gem.</p>
<p>Bad story short: </p>
<ul> 
<li>when using JVMPI (jdk 5.0 and below) you need to use this command line parameter and switch your jvm to the DevPartner-one -XrundpjCore:NM_ANALYSIS_TYPE={coverage,performance,memory}:NM_CONFIG_NAME={test-name} with perfomance being the default analysis type and the classname being the default config name.</li> 
<li>when using JVMTI (jdk 5.0 and above) you need to use this command line parameter and switch your jvm to the DevPartner-one -agentlib:dpjJvmtiCore=NM_ANALYSIS_TYPE={coverage,performance,memory},NM_CONFIG_NAME={test-name} with perfomance being the default analysis type and the classname being the default config name.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Don't we all love self explaining function and parameter names?</p>
