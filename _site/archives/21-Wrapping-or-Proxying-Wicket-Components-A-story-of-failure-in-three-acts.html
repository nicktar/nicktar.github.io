<p>When working on Wicket CRUDr, I encountered a problem which could be used easily by using a simple wrapper or proxy for existing components. These components are to be created by factory methods and need some additional functionality (like specific implementations of the onModelChanged-methods). Since I wanted to dumb down these factories and didn't want to have everyone implementing new factories to have to know about these, I thought, it would be nice to add the functionality afterwards.
</p>
<p>I tried three different approaches and none of them worked so, right now I've got to live without these features. Here is what I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a delegating wrapper</li>
<li>Using java.lang.Proxy</li>
<li>Using AOP (a) by Google Guice and (b) by Javassist<br /></li>
</ol>
