<p>What I like least in web development is to write simple CRUD editors. These no-brainer lists and forms without any logic or other fun stuff, that are needed just for data entry or administration of a web application. I don’t talk about any of these fancy client-facing editors that contain the juice of the application but the simple database-to-model-to-browser-to-model-to-database-workhorses that do the heavy lifting in the background. Other frameworks or programming languages try to help you writing these by providing scaffolding methods that either create those forms on the fly at runtime or by using code generators. There are a couple or attempts to do this with Wicket but none that suited my needs. <br /><a href="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/archives/20-Scaffolding-with-Wicket.html#extended">Continue reading “Scaffolding with Wicket”</a></p>
