          <p>For my current project which is in alpha-test right now, I wanted to verify a user's mail address on sign up, using the usual approach of sending him an email containing a link to a landing page, he has to visit to activate his account. To my surprise I couldn't find an existing implementation of this.</p>
<p>Taking a look at jForum, I decided not to use their way for not being wicket and for being a little over the top for my requirements.</p>
<p>These were:</p>
<ul> 
<li>I wanted a landing page with a decent looking URL</li> 
<li>I wanted to be able to use the same procedure for further landing pages like 'Forgot password' and the like, whatever 'the like' might be.</li> 
<li>I don't want to send HTML-emails. Plain-Text has always been good enough for me and since most of the email-readers transform URLs to links anyway, HTML would be an unnecessary overhead.</li> 
<li>I wanted the landing-page to throw 404 errors when called with incorrect or expired data.</li> 
</ul>

        <div class="container ">
          <p>When trying to build stateless pages without the user noticing, like building an application using AjaxFallBackLinks and reusing the fall-back to provide a search-engine-friendly version of your application, you've got to put the state into PageParamaters, which can be transported via bookmarkable links.</p>
<p>The most obvious way to access these Parameters from your Panel is a simple getPage().getPageParameters(). But as simple as it looks this is bad in a couple of ways. First it introduces tight coupling between your Panel and Page, which makes it hard to test (as in: you need to provide a page to test the Panel.). Second getPage() isn't available on construction-time. So calling getPage().getPageParameters() in the panel's constructor throws a NullPointerException.</p>
<p>If it's hard to test you're probably doing it wrong.</p>

        <div class="container ">
          <p>I'm stuck with an ancient version of DevPartner at work. For those of you luckily not knowing, what DevPartner is - It's a Profiler and it's the single worst documented software I was ever forced to use.<br />
When profiling a specific functionality to find out why it takes as long as it does, it's much more useful to write a UnitTest to profile said functionality than to invoke the whole stack from browser/applicationserver to database and below, which don't do much except from polluting your results. But since the latest Eclipse-Plugin for DevProfiler is aimed at Eclipse 3.0 (remember, that was released back in June 2004) there is no easy or even documented way to do so.<br />
Googleing isn't really useful until you remember that some parameter like -Xrun did the trick a couple of months back when you were trying to get this to work for the last time (wasting about a days worth of time trying to figure out, how). Provided with this parameter, Google points you to <a title="DevParnet Installation Guide" target="_blank" href="http://supportline.microfocus.com/Documentation/books/DevPartner/doc/DPJ/DPJ44/PDF/Installing_DevPartner_Java.pdf">the installation guide</a> (along with a couple of knowledge-base entries on how to manually integrate DevPartner into IntelliJ and NetBeans) where you can find a chapter filed under &quot;Configuring Application Servers&quot; named &quot;Manually invoking the Profiler&quot; and &quot;Using -Xrun to Invoke the Profiler&quot;. I don't know if it's just me or if an installation guide's chapter about integration into application servers is a slightly weird place to hide that gem.</p>
<p>Bad story short: </p>
<ul> 
<li>when using JVMPI (jdk 5.0 and below) you need to use this command line parameter and switch your jvm to the DevPartner-one -XrundpjCore:NM_ANALYSIS_TYPE={coverage,performance,memory}:NM_CONFIG_NAME={test-name} with perfomance being the default analysis type and the classname being the default config name.</li> 
<li>when using JVMTI (jdk 5.0 and above) you need to use this command line parameter and switch your jvm to the DevPartner-one -agentlib:dpjJvmtiCore=NM_ANALYSIS_TYPE={coverage,performance,memory},NM_CONFIG_NAME={test-name} with perfomance being the default analysis type and the classname being the default config name.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Don't we all love self explaining function and parameter names?</p>

The magic lies within the lines 12 and 13. Even if you've got no obvious value to set, when testing forms and formcomponents, you need to use FormTester no matter what.

Simple, easy and true but equaly easy to forget and thus wasting a couple of hours, trying to figure out what's wrong.

          <p>Most tutorials show how to either load the mail-properties from a file or setting them programmatically. These properties include an user name and a password to an SMTP-Server but connecting to said server fails if the server requests an user name and a password to connect. So setting these properties isn't sufficient. Digging deeper reveals a solution that isn't part of the most tutorials or even mentioned in most of the books like <a href="http://openbook.galileodesign.de/javainsel5/javainsel16_010.htm">this one</a> (German), albeit it's not the current edition but the one with the highest Page-rank in Google and the description was fixed in a <a href="http://openbook.galileodesign.de/javainsel7/javainsel_17_012.htm">later edition</a> and for some reason removed in the <a href="http://openbook.galileodesign.de/javainsel">current</a>.<br />
 But enough talk on to the good stuff:</p>

          <p>Considering myself a Linux-user rather than a power-user or even a Linux-Geek, I thought, I could pick up some tricks from this book. But to make it short: I was disappointed. At first I thought that maybe I just wasn't part of the target audience and that the book was a little bit mislabelled with &quot;Ubuntu for the computer illiterate&quot; being a more appropriate title. The authors describe at length all the useless stuff on how to make your system as unusable as possible with changed colours, fonts, wallpapers, custom icons for each and every folder or application. While being boring or at it's best repetitive. &quot;Open the Ubuntu Software Center, Search for this, provide your password when asked, you find your new application here.&quot; - &quot;Open the Ubuntu Software Center, Search for that, provide your password when asked, you find your new application here.&quot; - &quot;Open the Ubuntu Software Center, Search for something else, provide your password when asked, you find your new application here.&quot;<br />
 Then they explain how one can use Ubuntu to surf the internet (&quot;Open the Ubuntu Software Center, Search for this, provide your password when asked, you find your new application here.&quot;), play music (&quot;Open the Ubuntu Software Center, Search for this, provide your password when asked, you find your new application here.&quot;), watch DVDs (&quot;Open the Ubuntu Software Center, Search for this, provide your password when asked, you find your new application here.&quot;) or play games (your guess).<br />
 But the final straw came, when they called Java &quot;the mother of all scripting languages&quot; and stated that a JAR-file was &quot;what a Java script is called&quot;. That's where I stopped reading and tossed it in the bin, skipping the chapters about security, where I'd be most likely be told to open the Ubuntu Software Center, search for clamav, provide my password when prompted and look for my new anti-virus solution at some place or the other, using dual boot or sharing files with Windows computers and some other reasons to open the Ubuntu Software Center, search for something, provide my password when prompted and find my new application somewhere.<br />
 This book was a complete waste of money, time, paper and ink and I pity the trees that left their lives to print this.</p>

          <p>Wicket makes it easy to manipulate CSS attributes on the fly. The most obvious solution would be to overwrite the onComponentTag method and add the logic there. It's a very powerful solution as you can virtually do anything to the tag. But writing html fragments directly from my Java code is something that smells like JSPs and I don't like that smell.<br />
One of the greatest features of wicket is the separation of logic and data (code and html) and the requirement can be met without ruining that.<br />
Wicket offers 2 powerful classes to handle these. One is the <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.4/org/apache/wicket/behavior/SimpleAttributeModifier.html">SimpleAttributeModifier</a>, &quot;a lightweight version of the <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.4/org/apache/wicket/AttributeModifier.html">attribute modifier</a>.&quot; I never had to use the AttributeModifier as the simple version always was enough. The other one is the <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.4/org/apache/wicket/behavior/AttributeAppender.html">AttributeAppender</a>.<br />
The main difference between these two is how they react to existing attributes. The SimpleAttributeModifier replaces existing attributes of the same type (e.g. replaces the value of the class-attribute), while the AttributeAppender adds to it using a constructor-defined separator (like adding another class or appending more JavaScript to the onClick-attribute).<br />
A slightly different approach seems obvious when a button or other form element needs to be disabled, since Component offers a setEnabled(boolean) method. Unfortunately this method only set's wicket internal values. The JavaDoc suggests to overwrite this method for form elements but this isn't part of the wicket release, so this approach doesn't work. It sure would be easy to subclass the form elements and implement this (possibly using the AttributeAppender) but I favour Composition over Inheritance, so my solution would be to use the AttributeAppender directly when needed. Maybe when using wicket-security or some other framework to enable/disable buttons and links based on roles or principals this might not be the best solution but since I'm currently not using these...</p>

          <p><strong><u>Please note</u></strong>: This article applies to wicket versions prior to 1.5 only. Wicket 1.5 introduces an event bus to handle these types of requirements. The solution described here works but it has some issues that weren't completely resolved when I switched to Wicket 1.5. Most annoying among these is the rather tight coupling from the components to their page, which could be removed by extracting the IReflector-related code from the page and creating an own class for it.</p>
<hr width="100%" size="2" />
<p>More likely earlier than later while working with wicket one comes to the point, where there is the need to have one component to change based on an Ajax-event triggered inside another component. May this be a Logout Button that needs to be displayed after a successful login or a panel displaying shipping costs and updating these, whenever items are added to the cart or an address-panel to change it’s contents based on a contact selected.</p>

<p>Having one component update another introduces tight coupling, reduces the re usability of the components involved, gets increasingly hard to maintain and just smells really bad.</p>
<p>To fix this, one could wait for the event-bus of wicket 1.5 or work around it by simulating something resembling said event-bus. As usual with software development there are several ways to archive this (The good, the other good one and the ugly as seen above). Like many other coupling problems the main solution to this is some idea known as Inversion of Control, which can be freely translated to the words of JFK - &quot;Don't ask what your component can do for you. Ask, what you can do for your component.&quot;</p>

<p>Question: What gets printed? (Solution hidden behind the &quot;Continue Reading&quot; link)</p>
<p>To understand what's going on, one has to dive into the inner workings of HashMap... The HashMap is used to store key value pairs but it does so by combining them into an Entry-object containing both objects and stores these in an array. So when you call put on an HashMap (for simplicity assuming your key isn't null) first the hashCode() function of your key is called. Then HashMap works it's magic. It moves the hash to the left by 9 bits (multiplies with 512 and might switch the sign of the number a couple of times. Then the result is complemented (each bit shifted) and added to the original hash value. Then it shifts the result (including the sign) to the right by 14 bits, adding 0 to the left side and sets the intermediate result to a bitwise xor of this shifted value and the sum of the last step. Then it repeats the first step but shifting only by 4 bits (multiplies with 16) and omitting the compliment and repeats step 2 with a right shift of 10 bits.</p>
<p>OK, that should leave everyone (including me) confused. Let's try to shed some light...<br /> Example:<br /> The hashCode-function of your object returns 31 (a very plain object using a very plain hashCode implementation).</p>
<pre style="color: #000000;">int h = 31<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span>
System.out.println(h + " - " + Integer.toBinaryString(h))<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span> <span style="color:#696969; ">// 31 - 11111</span>
h += ~(h &lt;&lt; 9)<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span>
System.out.println(h + " - " + Integer.toBinaryString(h))<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span> <span style="color:#696969; ">// -15842 - 11111111111111111100001000011110</span>
h ^=  (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 14)<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span>
System.out.println(h + " - " + Integer.toBinaryString(h))<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span> <span style="color:#696969; ">// -246303 - 11111111111111000011110111100001</span>
h ^=  (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 10)<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span>
System.out.println(h + " - " + Integer.toBinaryString(h))<span style="color:#555555; ">;</span> <span style="color:#696969; ">// -3947794 - 11111111110000111100001011101110</span>
</pre>
<p>That leaves us with an internal hash of -3947794 and no idea what it's good for. But the HashMap isn't done yet. I computes an index based on this value and a bitwise and of the length of the internal table -1. Starting from that index the map iterates through the entries. Yes, these nasty little buggers form a linked list by containing a next-reference. For each iteration it checks if</p>
<p>a) the recorded internal hashCode matches the internal hashCode of the new key and<br /> b) the key is identical or equal to the stored key.</p>
<p>If a matching key is found, the value is replaced. If no matching key is found, it adds the new entity object at the start of the linked list of the computed table index and maybe resizing the table and redistributing the buckets.</p>
<p>To retrieve a value the key is submitted to the very same steps but since the internal hash isn't recalculated whenever the key-object changes, the changed key yields a different internal hash, and a different internal bucket (that's what the linked lists are) and will not be found.</p>
<p>Summary:<br />When storing a value to a specific key in a HashMap, the corresponding hashCode is computed and stored. If you later change your key-object in a way that changes it's hashCode, these will no longer match.<br /></p>

          <p>It's stated in the docs but it seems like everyone has to run into this at least once....</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The <tt>HashMap</tt> class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>Being unsynchronized doesn't by default flag something as not thread-safe but it raises at least some concerns. In case of the <tt>HashMap</tt> these are valid. When adding entries to the map it might be necessary to adapt the map's size and to do so, the <tt>HashMap</tt> redistributes the entries into new buckets. Adding more entries during this process might screw the whole map, while retrieving data during redistribution might yield wrong values or no values at all.</p>
<p> The easiest way around this is the use of <tt>Hashtables</tt> where ever you need to store data in a <tt>HashMap</tt>py way in a multithreaded environment. But this only works if you can live without <tt>null</tt> keys and values. The other solution is <tt>Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap());</tt>.</p>

          <p>With the continuous stream of reports about hacked websites it never fails to baffle me, that these sites still fail to take even the simplest steps to protect their user's passwords. Storing them in plain-text in your database isn't secure, you could as well just post them on your main page. But still the published database dumps don't stop to contain these. Are these developers just ignorant or incompetent? Are these old legacy apps once developed by overpaid consultants and not updated ever after? Maybe it's like Marcus Carey (security researcher &amp; community manager at Rapid7) said: &quot;Many businesses outsource web application development and once the application is deployed, service contracts may lapse or IT staff may not be paying much attention to them.&quot; I don't know and most likely I never will.</p>

          <p>Most of us know that an array in Java can be initialized by</p>
<pre>String[] fruit = new String[] {"apple", "cherry"};</pre>
<p>I say &quot;most&quot; and not &quot;all&quot; since arrays aren't that common in everyday Java usage with all those handy collections around. One of the major (perseived) downsides of those, they're ugly to initialize.</p>
<pre>List fruit = new ArrayList("apple", "cherry");</pre>
<p>just doesn't work and</p>
<pre>List fruit = new ArrayList();
fruit.add("apple");
fruit.add("cherry");</pre>
<p>doesn't look to nice. But did you know, you could do this?</p>
<pre>List fruit = new ArrayList() ;</pre>
<p>O.K. basically it looks very similar (except for the missing variable names) and it gives the same result so why bother? First it's optically separated from the rest of the code, thus easily recognized as an initializer for the list. Second it's not just a new list and two elements added to it. It's an anonymous subclass of ArrayList with a static initializer, thus an innocent @SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;) might be needed to silence your compiler's warnings...</p>

I decided that the best place would be the webserver users home directory, which solves the problem of having different configurations on different systems but introduces a new risk of a new deploy-step needed to update changed configurations (namely added database entities in hibernate.cfg.xml) which I simply forgot more than once. Since it only happened on the test server which didn't start due to missing entities this was easy to spot, easy to fix and not a problem as such. But chances are, that this might happen with more important things that don't fail at once so there's got to be a better way, which comes by the name of JNDI (which translates to <em>Java Naming and Directory Interface</em> and not to <em>Just Not Directly Intuitive</em> which might be fitting as well).</p>
<p>JNDI offloads the burden of acquiring resources from your web-application to your application server. Considering that these are most likely to stay the same for each given environment this sounds like a really good idea. Additionally it allows you to separate your Hibernate configuration from your database and C3P0 config which is a good idea on it's own as well.</p>

          <p>Shortly after hitting the 2000 readers mark, this is the next major step for this blog (at least as far as I'm concerned). I decided to leave my <a href="http://www.blog.de">previous provider</a> and move the blog over to my server. It might seem&#160; odd to host a blog about java-development with an additional focus on Apache Wicket using a PHP powered blog software, but I just didn't like JRoller and writing my own doesn't seem interesting enough right now with all those pet projects and ideas haunting my mind. So, that's it, Wicket Game will be running from this site, will be PHP driven and not following the NIH-pattern for time being. I wouldn't say &quot;from now on&quot; since this is just a side project to my pet projects and I don't want to commit myself to this software, this domain or this URL...</p>
<p>I will continue to post here (now that the new base is set up) and will successively replace the content of the <a href="http://wicket-game.blog.de">old blog</a> with pointers to new moved entries. <br /></p>

          <p>What I like least in web development is to write simple CRUD editors. These no-brainer lists and forms without any logic or other fun stuff, that are needed just for data entry or administration of a web application. I don’t talk about any of these fancy client-facing editors that contain the juice of the application but the simple database-to-model-to-browser-to-model-to-database-workhorses that do the heavy lifting in the background. Other frameworks or programming languages try to help you writing these by providing scaffolding methods that either create those forms on the fly at runtime or by using code generators. There are a couple or attempts to do this with Wicket but none that suited my needs. <br /><a href="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/archives/20-Scaffolding-with-Wicket.html#extended">Continue reading “Scaffolding with Wicket”</a></p>

          <p>When working on Wicket CRUDr, I encountered a problem which could be used easily by using a simple wrapper or proxy for existing components. These components are to be created by factory methods and need some additional functionality (like specific implementations of the onModelChanged-methods). Since I wanted to dumb down these factories and didn't want to have everyone implementing new factories to have to know about these, I thought, it would be nice to add the functionality afterwards.
</p>
<p>I tried three different approaches and none of them worked so, right now I've got to live without these features. Here is what I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a delegating wrapper</li>
<li>Using java.lang.Proxy</li>
<li>Using AOP (a) by Google Guice and (b) by Javassist<br /></li>

<p>there are countless combinations to test. It would be easy if new Lister() would work, but it doesn’t (otherwise this article wouldn’t make any sense at all). There are several solutions for this… What I’d call a plain core Java solution, an easy workaround, a little hack and my favourite. I’ll describe them all so you can take your pick.<br /></p>

          <p>When I set out to create Wicket-CRUD, I envisioned a small and lightweight set of components that would deliver all the basic scaffolding options to Wicket. Right now I'm not so sure about the lightweight-part. I's still a small set of components (a table-component, an editor, some Annotations and an Interface) with a small API. I don't know when I started on the path of over engineering but I think right now I'm committed to it (at least for this project). Two collumn-types collectiong their various parts to provide all the functionality from several providers created by a couple of factories, kept together (and apart) by no less than 8 Interfaces... All in all the project contains some 50 code-files and it's still growing. </p>
<p>For those interested, I set up the project on ohloh.net <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wicket-crudr?ref=WidgetProjectPartnerBadge" target="_top"><img border="0" height="33" width="193" align="right" alt="Ohloh project report for wicket-CRUDr" src="http://www.ohloh.net/p/wicket-crudr/widgets/project_partner_badge.gif" /></a>

 this moment, since the code is still constantly changing and growing.<br /><br /></p>

          <p>UnitTests are great. Period. This fact has been established among developers. It helps to make sure your new code doesn't break anything else. It gives you regression testing &quot;for free&quot; and it can even be used as a design method (Test Driven Development). But tests break and they don't only break when code changes and new bugs are introduced to the system. They might break more or less on their own, when they aren't properly written. This causes work since you'll have to find out why this test is broken. Did you just break the feature under test or was the test just to fragile? was it you or was it the developer of the test?<br /></p>
<p>Writing UnitTests isn't hard. It's just different from writing other code. While developing software is about making all the code interact, writing UnitTests is about taking things apart, identifying units as the-parts-to-test and encapsulating them from everything outside. </p>
<p>Good tests are robust to any change happening to the environment or any changes to all the code outside their specific unit. There are some principles that help to make tests clean, easy and most of all robust.</p>
<p>Most of the following stuff uses Java terminology but it applies and can be applied to any other language.<br /></p>

<pre>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, a <strong>stack</strong> is a last in, first out (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_%28computing%29" title="LIFO (computing)">LIFO</a>)

<p align="right">from wikipedia </p>
<p>The key characteristic here is &quot;last in, first out&quot;. So, when I do something like this:</p>
<pre style="color: #000000;">Stack<span style="color:#555555; ">&lt;</span><span style="color:#575757; font-weight:bold; ">String</span><span style="color:#555555; ">&gt;</span> myStack <span style="color:#555555; ">=</span> new Stack<span style="color:#555555; ">&lt;</span><span style="color:#575757; font-weight:bold; ">String</span><span style="color:#555555; ">&gt;</span><span style="color:#555555; ">(</span><span style="color:#555555; ">)</span><span style="color:#555555; ">;</span>

</pre>
<p>and then &quot;go through&quot; the stack and print every item, I'd expect something very much like <strong>dcba</strong> as the result, pretty much like what I get doing this:

</p>
<p> </p>
<pre style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: rgb(87, 87, 87); font-weight: bold;">while</span> <span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">!</span>myStack<span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">.</span>empty<span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">(</span><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">)</span><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">)</span> <span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">{</span>

<span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">}</span></pre>
<p>But completely different from what I get doing this:</p>
<pre style="color: #000000;"><span style="color:#575757; font-weight:bold; ">for</span> <span style="color:#555555; ">(</span><span style="color:#575757; font-weight:bold; ">String</span> item<span style="color:#555555; ">:</span> myStack<span style="color:#555555; ">)</span> <span style="color:#555555; ">{</span>

<span style="color:#555555; ">}</span>
</pre>
<p>This prints <strong>abcd</strong>, which is definitely surprising, at least to me and it's so surprising that it fools me every time I use this class. A stack a such should offer two functions, push and pop and maybe a peek-method as well. It's meant to store data and return it in reverse order while destroying itself. I'm not sure if I'd expect the foreach to destroy my stack but I' pretty sure, this shouldn't implement a hidden reverse or invert method.

Requiring X years of experience in some more or less arcane field or language wouldn't do the trick. What separates the good developer from a mediocre one isn't years of experience in a specific field but an insatiable hunger for new stuff and things to learn. It's the love to sharpen one's mind understanding new concepts and toys. A mediocre developer will be happy having mastered one specific task and tends to accumulate years of experience without ever pushing the barriers&#160; of his or her abilities where a good one would have tried to push back the boundaries of his or her knowledge at all times and thus have adopted new fields and languages. This doesn't say he or she would constantly change jobs. A good employer for a good developer would allow (and even support and depend on) this hunger and offer sufficient legroom and breathing space within the organization.</p>
<p>You can't have the cake and eat it. You can't have a good developer with a sharp mind and expecting he or she was just sitting at one place for years.</p>

the procurement people as the unethical con artists, wiggling their way 
into honest sales meetings to play their games, swindle and trick the 
hapless sales representative into granting them discounts, they are.

          <p>Now, that the project is a little more than 7 months old and taking it slow due to other obligations, I'd like to offer a little summary on the current state of the project.</p>
<p>I've spent a couple of hours starting a demo application using Wicket-CRUDr to show and keep track of what the framework can do right now. This application is the current Proof of Concept for the project, so whenever I run into an issue, I stop working on the application and fix the framework instead. This is necessary since there is no such thing as a project plan or even QA beyond Unittests. Main issue right now is a bug where somewhere between a displayed object and the list it contains, the model-chain is broken so that the model of the list isn't updated. Since the framework relies heavily on builders and factories this is quite hard to track (as usual when there are factories involved). <br /></p>

        <div class="container ">
          <p>I was finally able to track down the elusive bug mentioned in last month's SOTP, where 1:n relationships weren't displayed correctly after the model of the master component got changed. Since they weren't updated along with the rest of the displayed data, I was hunting for the place where the model chain was broken. As the model chain was in fact unbroken, this search took me a couple of days but didn't help at all. The reason why the data wasn't displayed corretly was the fact that these relations were constructed with a wrong type of model provider and thus a properly chained but completely wrong model was used. Now it kind of works but this spot needs more work done before I'm happy with this.</p>
<p>As a lookout, Wicket-CRUDr will see a change of paradigm. Right now, everything you want scaffolded has to be annotated and everything you want to edit has to be annotated to. This will change so that every method on the wrapper starting with &quot;get&quot; or &quot;is&quot; will result in this property displayed unless annotated with @Ignore and likewise every method starting with &quot;set&quot; will result in this property beeing editable unless ignore-annotated.<br /></p>

          <p>Some time ago I gave a speech on what the Java Virtual Machine (and to a much lesser extent the Java compiler) do automatically to optimize your code, thus sparing us the hassle (and the resulting ugly code) to do it ourselves. This is intended to be a series looking at what’s done automatically and how this will, can or should affect our coding habits. The first part will have a look at some really old advice from the time, when Java was truely slow. This means the late 1990s when Java was interpreted at runtime and didn’t sport a JIT-Compiler (which was added in J2SE 1.2 (Codename Playground) in December 1998) or even the HotSpot VM (which was released in April 1999 and introduced into Java in J2SE 1.3 (Codename Kestrel) in May 2000). <br /> <br /><a href="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/archives/39-Automagic-optimization-in-Java-Part-I-Preface.html#extended">Continue reading “Automagic optimization in Java - Part I (Preface)”</a></p>

          <p>One of the most intuitive optimizations the JVM performs is method inlining. It adresses two performance issues and if kept in mind might lead to a code that's better structured and readable. Methods as a concept are quite expensive. To call a method, the JVM has to find the target for dynamic invocation, has to store the current scope on stack, has to jump to the method in question. After executing the method, the JVM has to retrieve the saved scope from the stack and resume working where it left of. Additionally method calls reduce the effectiveness of other optimization methods.</p>
<p>But thanks to the automatic method inlining that's of (close to) no concern to the developer.<br /></p>

<p>The Lister Annotation is gone and the Editor Annotation is about to follow. This reduced the codebase a little but produced Prototypes with a higher readability. Prototypes are the classes of entities that CRUDr displays. These classes have to be annotated using the Prototype Annotation.</p>
<p>I'm currently thinking about pre releasing an alpha version with the readonly components implemented. <br /></p>
