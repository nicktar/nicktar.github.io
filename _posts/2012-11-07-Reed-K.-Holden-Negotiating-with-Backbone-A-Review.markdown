<p><!-- s9ymdb:27 --><img width="112" height="146" align="right" title="Frontcover" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px;" src="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/uploads/holden_NwB.jpg" class="serendipity_image_right" />When I found this book at a 2nd hand bookstore, I didn't really notice the subtitle and since I'm notoriously bad at negotiating, I bought it. Later at home I realized that it was &quot;<span id="btAsinTitle">Eight Sales Strategies to Defend Your Price and Value&quot;, which still might do me some good but starting through the pages my doubt increased as it is clearly addressed at Sales Reps. I decided to join the ride just to see how it turns out and it turned out quite entertaining but only if you're a evil, black-hearted and nasty wretch like me. </span></p> 
<p><span id="btAsinTitle">Holden, who paints himself as some high and 
mighty Sales guru and pricing expert, which I can't assess to since 
sales is clearly not my trade, starts whining about these evil people in
 procurement spoiling the life for sales people by trying to drive the 
prices down. This sets the tone for the next chapters, where he exposes 
the procurement people as the unethical con artists, wiggling their way 
into honest sales meetings to play their games, swindle and trick the 
hapless sales representative into granting them discounts, they are. 
These are mostly Holden's words as he describes how procurement tries to
 throw the sales rep of by playing &quot;good cop - bad cop&quot; on him, 
seemingly canceling agreed contracts and show him fake summaries about 
competitors.</span> <br /></p>
