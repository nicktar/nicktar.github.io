<p>Sorry for posting this quite late or missing the January update (depenting on the point of view). The new year started with a high workload at the office so that there weren't many days were I wanted to continue working at home. So this is pretty short.</p> 
<p>The Lister Annotation is gone and the Editor Annotation is about to follow. This reduced the codebase a little but produced Prototypes with a higher readability. Prototypes are the classes of entities that CRUDr displays. These classes have to be annotated using the Prototype Annotation.</p>
<p>I'm currently thinking about pre releasing an alpha version with the readonly components implemented. <br /></p> <br /><a href="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/archives/41-SOTP-State-of-the-Project-JanuaryFebruary-2013.html#extended">Continue reading "SOTP (State of the Project) - January/February 2013"</a>
