Some time ago I gave a speech on what the Java Virtual Machine (and to a much lesser extent the Java compiler) do automatically to optimize your code, thus sparing us the hassle (and the resulting ugly code) to do it ourselves. This is intended to be a series looking at what's done automatically and how this will, can or should affect our coding habits. The first part will have a look at some really old advice from the time, when Java was truely slow. This means the late 1990s when Java was interpreted at runtime and didn't sport a JIT-Compiler (which was added in J2SE 1.2 (Codename Playground) in December 1998) or even the HotSpot VM (which was released in April 1999 and introduced into Java in J2SE 1.3 (Codename Kestrel) in May 2000). <br /> <br /><a href="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/archives/39-Automagic-optimization-in-Java-Part-I-Preface.html#extended">Continue reading "Automagic optimization in Java - Part I (Preface)"</a>
