<p>UnitTests are great. Period. This fact has been established among developers. It helps to make sure your new code doesn't break anything else. It gives you regression testing &quot;for free&quot; and it can even be used as a design method (Test Driven Development). But tests break and they don't only break when code changes and new bugs are introduced to the system. They might break more or less on their own, when they aren't properly written. This causes work since you'll have to find out why this test is broken. Did you just break the feature under test or was the test just to fragile? was it you or was it the developer of the test?<br /></p> 
<p>Writing UnitTests isn't hard. It's just different from writing other code. While developing software is about making all the code interact, writing UnitTests is about taking things apart, identifying units as the-parts-to-test and encapsulating them from everything outside. </p> 
<p>Good tests are robust to any change happening to the environment or any changes to all the code outside their specific unit. There are some principles that help to make tests clean, easy and most of all robust.</p>
<p>Most of the following stuff uses Java terminology but it applies and can be applied to any other language.<br /></p> <br /><a href="http://wicket-game.gwassist.de/archives/26-Dont-you-hate-it-when-your-UnitTests-break.html#extended">Continue reading "Don't you hate it when your UnitTests break?"</a>
