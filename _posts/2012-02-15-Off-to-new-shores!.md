Shortly after hitting the 2000 readers mark, this is the next major step for this blog (at least as far as I'm concerned). I decided to leave my [previous provider](http://www.blog.de) and move the blog over to my server. It might seem odd to host a blog about java-development with an additional focus on Apache Wicket using a PHP powered blog software, but I just didn't like JRoller and writing my own doesn't seem interesting enough right now with all those pet projects and ideas haunting my mind. So, that's it, Wicket Game will be running from this site, will be PHP driven and not following the NIH-pattern for time being. I wouldn't say "from now on" since this is just a side project to my pet projects and I don't want to commit myself to this software, this domain or this URL...

I will continue to post here (now that the new base is set up) and will successively replace the content of the [old blog](http://wicket-game.blog.de) with pointers to new moved entries.
