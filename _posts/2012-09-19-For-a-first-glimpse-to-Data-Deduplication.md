Data Deduplication fascinates me, that's a fact. As one of the three most interesting topics in the field of software development (with Neuronal Networks and Genetic Algorithms being the other two) it pops up in my head from time to time. When this happened again and I had some spare time, I found this article titled [Rabin algorithm â€“ the mother of deduplication technologies](http://www.infineta.com/blog/rabin-algorithm-%E2%80%93-mother-deduplication-technologies)" over at the Infineta blog. It offers some basic insights on how Data Deduplication works even if it stays very firmly on the theoretical/mathematical side.
