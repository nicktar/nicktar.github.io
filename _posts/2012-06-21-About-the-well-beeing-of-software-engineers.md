It's a real great write-up about the mindset of software-engineers and on how to keep them happy.


I know this is a lot to read but it's worth every second. This is the very first text on this where I could sign every single statement. Whenever Nicholas C. Zakas uses the term &quot;we software-engineers&quot; or anything similar I could easily replace it with an &quot;I&quot; and still feel very good with this article.
