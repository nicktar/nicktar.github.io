At some time during the last night, this blog saw the 2000th reader passing through. Starting very late in March 2011, it first picked up some readers with a non Wicket related [rant]({% post_url 2011-04-26-Rickford-Grant-Phil-Bull-Ubuntu-for-Non-Geeks-A-Review | absolute_url%}) which is still number two in the list of the most-read posts, second only to [a little tale about wickettester]({% post_url 2011-04-03-Testing-an-AjaxCheckBox-in-WicketTester | absolute_url%}).



I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone, feel free to comment, ask questions, read silently, point out mistakes or just stop by.
