<p>Most tutorials show how to either load the mail-properties from a file or setting them programmatically. These properties include an user name and a password to an SMTP-Server but connecting to said server fails if the server requests an user name and a password to connect. So setting these properties isn't sufficient. Digging deeper reveals a solution that isn't part of the most tutorials or even mentioned in most of the books like <a href="http://openbook.galileodesign.de/javainsel5/javainsel16_010.htm">this one</a> (German), albeit it's not the current edition but the one with the highest Page-rank in Google and the description was fixed in a <a href="http://openbook.galileodesign.de/javainsel7/javainsel_17_012.htm">later edition</a> and for some reason removed in the <a href="http://openbook.galileodesign.de/javainsel">current</a>.<br />
