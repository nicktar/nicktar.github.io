Meet the elephant in the room, wicket-crudr is pretty dead. After no commits for more than 2 years it still targets wicket 1.5, the latest version of wicket that I used. It still uses Java 7, which might be good for some years at least but I haven't checked the dependencies in two years either.
So after over 9000 lines of code, an oloh-estimated value just above of 100 thousand dollars and lots of fun, I'm officially abandoning the project. If anyone wants to continue and give it an overhaul, just drop me a line.


As I stopped using wicket it just doesn't make sense to keep this around any longer. S
